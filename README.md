## Overview

Use of this COVID-19 self-checker algorithm and associated files does not imply a CDC endorsement of any one particular product, service or enterprise. U.S. Government logos, including the CDC logo, cannot be used without express, written permission. This COVID-19 self-checker algorithm was designed based on the best available science and should not be modified or altered. Use of the COVID-19 self-checker algorithm must be accompanied by the following disclaimer and non-endorsement language:

This COVID-19 self-checker algorithm was originally developed by CDC for use as an interactive “bot” experience. CDC does not guarantee the accuracy of any non-U.S. Government version(s) of a COVID-19 self-checker algorithm. The U.S. Government does not make any warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, for any non-U.S. Government version of the COVID-19 self-checker algorithm . Use by a non-U.S. Government organization or enterprise does not imply a U.S. Government endorsement of any one particular product, service, or enterprise or that this use of the COVID-19 self-checker algorithm represents the official views of the U.S. Government.

## Getting Started

1. Create a Microsoft Health Bot via the [Microsoft Health Bot Admin portal](https://admin.healthbot.microsoft.com/)
2. Configure the bot according to [Microsoft Health Bot documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/HealthBot/)
3. Import the Covid-19 Protocol.json file from this repository to the Microsoft Health Bot
4. Open that health bot and click "run".

You should now have a health-bot that behaves the same way CDC's does, but it is your copy so you can start to modify it.
